# cozmo_tracking
This repository implements various vision algorithms to detect and track [ArUco markers](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html). The final goal is to keep track of an Anki [Cozmo](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/cozmo) robot's location in a maze using a top-view camera. The most useful Python script is [`aruco_detector.py`](aruco/aruco_detector.py): it simply detects the position of an Aruco marker placed on top of the robot's head and compute its relative location with respect to the other four "boundary" ArUco markers. It does *not* make use of the information in such markers to compute the camera pose (which requires to calibrate the camera) hence assuming a top-view camera, far enough from the maze and centered. Such a calibration-based alternative might be considered as further improvement.
